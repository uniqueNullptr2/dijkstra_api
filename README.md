# dijkstra_api
This is a take home exercise from a job interview

## Basic description
There are 2 maps. One denotes the type of tile (W for water, L for Land) and the other denotes the level of danger of that tile.
Find the least dangerous Path between two points. The level of danger is the sum of the danger of each tile that is moved through.
On land you can only move up, down, left and right. On water the danger is halved but each tile moved though adds 1 to the dangerlevel. In water you can move diagonally.

## Tasks
- include OpenAPI documentation
- Write Unit-Tests
- create a small Frontend
- Create two endpoints. One for Land only pathing and a separate one that allows moving through water
- the Enpoints should return the overall danger level as well as the path taken
